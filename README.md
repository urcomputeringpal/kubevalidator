# kubevalidator

A GitHub App that validates the Kubernetes YAML in your GitHub PRs using [kubeval](https://github.com/garethr/kubeval).

### Example

![](https://urcomputeringpal.com/assets/kubevalidator.gif)

### Goals

* Improve the experience of changing and reviewing YAML documents representing Kubernetes resources by detecting and highlighting errors automatically.
* Allow validation against multiple schemas to support applications deployed to multiple Kubernetes clusters with disparate versions.
* Explore the viability of writing a generalized [Probot](http://probot.github.io/)-like GitHub App toolkit in Golang.

### Non-goals

* Validate the syntax of your YAML. (Shameless plug: use [YAMBURGER](https://github.com/urcomputeringpal/yamburger) for that! It's kinda dope!)

## Configuration

kubevalidator depends on you to tell it which YAML in your repository it should validate using a file at `.github/kubevalidator.yaml`. [This repo's config](./.github/kubevalidator.yaml) is a decent example:

```yaml
apiversion: v1alpha
kind: KubeValidatorConfig
spec:
  manifests:
  - glob: config/kubernetes/default/*/*.yaml
    schemas:
    - version: 1.13.0
    - version: 1.13.3
    #
    # Schema options and their defaults. See config.go for more details.
    #

    # version: 'master'
    # name: 'human readable name' # defaults to the value of version

    # If the schemas in https://github.com/garethr/kubernetes-json-schema
    # don't work for you, fork it and drop your username here! Your schemas
    # will be used instead.
    #
    # schemaFork: garethr

    # Set this to openshift to use schemas from
    # https://github.com/garethr/openshift-json-schema instead.
    #
    # type: kubernetes

```

## Deploying your own instance

These instructions are untested. Please open a new issue or PR if you run into any problems or would prefer to use another deployment tool!

* Fork & clone this repo.
* Edit or delete the included [Ingress](./config/kubernetes/default/ingresses/kubevalidator.yaml) and/or [Service](./config/kubernetes/default/ingresses/kubevalidator.yaml) resources to match your target cluster's load balancing requirements.
* Create a new GitHub App with the following settings:
  * Homepage URL: the URL to the GitHub repository for your app
  * Webhook URL: Use https://example.com/ for now, we'll come back in a minute to update this with the URL of your deployed app.
  * Webhook Secret: Generate a unique secret with `openssl rand -base64 32` and save it because you'll need it in a minute to configure your deployed app
  * Permissions:
    * Checks: Read & Write
    * Repository contents: Read-only
    * Repository metadata: Read-only
    * Pull requests: Read-only
  * Webhooks:
    * Check Suite
    * Pull Request
* Generate and download a new key for your app. Note the path.
* Create a secret with values to authenticate your instance of kubevalidator as your GitHub app

```
kubectl create secret generic kubevalidator
    --from-file=PRIVATE_KEY=~/Downloads/path-to-kubeval-key.pem \
    --from-literal=APP_ID=1234 \
    --from-literal=WEBHOOK_SECRET=1234 \
    --dry-run=true -o yaml > config/kubernetes/default/secrets/kubeval.yaml
```


* Configure access to a Kubernetes cluster.
* Create a `kubevalidator` namespace on that cluster.
* Install [Skaffold](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold).
* Point `build.artifacts[0].image` in skaffold.yaml to an accessible docker image path, and make sure it matches the image specified in the `kubernetes/default/deployments/kubevalidator.yaml` deployment manifest 
* Run `skaffold run` to deploy this application to your cluster!

## Acknowledgements

* :bow: to @keavy, @kytrinyx, @lizzhale and many more for your work on [GitHub Checks](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/). PRs aren't ever going to be the same.
* :bow: to @garethr for your work on [kubeval](https://github.com/garethr/kubeval). It does all of the heavy lifting here, I've just put some GitHub-flavored window dressing on top.
* :bow: to @bkeepers for your work on [Probot](http://probot.github.io/). I've learned a ton building Probot apps in the past few months, and hope that you don't mind that I've poorly re-implemented a small portion of it in Golang in this project. :wink:
